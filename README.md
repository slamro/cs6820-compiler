# cs6820-compiler
really bad compiler


I built my a.o in the general folder. To run a.o, pass a file in from the program_input folder. Basically only the basics-new works. 
The out put is in assem_output where nasm will build its .o file.
I also put the executable file from the gcc into the general folder as well.
